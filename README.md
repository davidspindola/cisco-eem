# EEM Scripts For Cisco Devices

**The scripts in this repository were tested in devices within a specific lab environment. All of the devices used in this document started with a cleared (default) configuration. If your network is live, make sure that you understand the potential impact of any command.**

*Each script includes, at the header, the device and version in which was tested.*

Script header format:

```
! Date formatted as RFC2822
!
! #Title of the script
! Description or purpose
!  * HW: Device is which was tested
!  * SW: Version in which it was tested
!
! Trigger:
!  Trigger description
```

All the scripts:

* Assume that you use the correct mode to apply the configuration
* Bypass AAA authorization
* Include a maximum time to run
